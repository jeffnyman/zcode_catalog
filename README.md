# Z-Code Catalog

The game files collected here are [z-code](http://inform-fiction.org/zmachine/standards/) files. These are meant to be run on an [interpreter](http://ifwiki.org/index.php/List_of_Z-machine_interpreters) that emulates the [Z-Machine](http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Z-machine).

Most of these story files are from the now-defunct company [Infocom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infocom).

These z-code files come in various versions. Infocom referred to these as "zip" (versions 1, 2, and 3), "ezip" (version 4), "xzip" (version 5), and "yzip" (version 6). Infocom used the ".zip" file extension for all of these files and the actual z-code version was encoded as the first byte of the z-code file. Given that ".zip" eventually became a well-established extension for a compression format, the convention now is to provide extensions such as ".z1", ".z2", ".z3", ".z4", ".z5", ".z6".

Within even the concept of a given z-code version, there were often different releases of the story files which also often had a different serial number. All of this information is preserved in the file naming convention for all files in this repository.

Note that this is a repository that will be slowly built up over time. It exists now so that I can start building my own Z-Machine emulator and interpreter.

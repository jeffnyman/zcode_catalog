# TerpEtude: A Z-Machine Interpreter Exerciser

This folder contains all the Inform 6 source code for TerpEtude:

* etude.inf
* accents.inc
* accentin.inc
* color.inc
* division.inc
* exittext.inc
* givenin.inc
* header.inc
* styles.inc
* timedch.inc
* timedstr.inc
* undo.inc

The reason for including all of this is that if you want to test your interpreter, you can't really know what exactly you are testing for unless you can see exactly what the tests are.

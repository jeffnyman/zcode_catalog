# Zork I Source Code

This directory contains the source code for the *Zork I* game, including a variety of files both used and discarded in the production of the game. The game itself is written in [ZIL](http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/ZIL) (Zork Implementation Language), which was a refactoring of [MDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDL_(programming_language)) (Muddle), which was itself a dialect of [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)).

There is currently no known way to compile the source code in this repository into a final "Z-machine Interpreter Program" (ZIP) file using an *official* Infocom-built compiler. There is, however, an *unofficial* compiler named [ZILF](http://zilf.io) that can successfully compile these .ZIL files into a working game.

Note that this source code is a direct copy of the [Historical Source *Zork I*](https://github.com/historicalsource/zork1).
